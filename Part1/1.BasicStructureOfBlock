Each block has an index, a timestamp (in Unix time), a list of transactions, a proof , and the hash of the previous block
each new block contains within itself, the hash of the previous Block.
 This is crucial because it's what gives blockchains immutability: If an attacker corrupted an earlier Block in
 the chain then all subsequent blocks will contain incorrect hashes.

    'index': 1,
    'timestamp': 1506057125.900785,
